Used the following tutorial as a starting point, though some adjustments were necisary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZ05pnHZqM&t=1809s

1. Download the release candidate kernel from kerenl.org as a tar and extract
	it to a working directory.

2. Copy the current kernel's config file from /boot/config-<kernel name>-generic 
	to .config to the source directory. The location of the config file may very 
	between different distributions.

3. run "make oldconfig" to adjust .config accordingly to the new kernel.

4. Install necisary dependencies listed
	at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/process/changes.html.
	Note the on Pop OS, and I assume other Debian like distributions, it is
	necisary to install libelf-dev and libssl-dev.

5. In .config file, set both CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS to "".

6. Run "sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 module_install" If you do not include
	the INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 option, the kernel will be huge, upwards of 1 GB,
	and will fill up your EFI partiton.

7. Run "sudo make install" in source directory to install the kernel.
